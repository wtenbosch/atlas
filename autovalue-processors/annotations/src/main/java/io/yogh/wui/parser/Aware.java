/**
 * This annotation exists purely to guide the eclipse annotation environment to a class the processing environment needs to be aware of.
 * 
 * Processors may register to the Aware annotation and patch whatever class(es) are in it into its processing.
 * 
 * Some IDEs (cough Eclipse) include only a (very) limited set of elements in its RoundEnvironment while processing annotations. It is possible an
 * annotation processor depends on processing in a wider set of elements and will consequently not produce correct results. This solution alleviates
 * this problem by at least making the processor aware of it and allowing it to correct for it / adapt to it.
